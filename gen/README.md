The clang generators will automatically generate wrappers for a C library based on its headers. So everything you see in libportaudio.jl is automatically generated from the C library. If a newer version of portaudio adds more features, we won't have to add new wrappers: clang will handle it for us. It is easy to use currently unused features: the wrappers have already been written for us. Even though it does an admirable job, clang doesn't handle errors and set locks. Fortunately, it's very easy to add secondary wrappers, or just do it at point of use.
